# Netatmo

[Netatmo](https://www.netatmo.com/en-eu) is a smart home weather station. Different modules can be combined to measure temperature, rain, wind, etc. Measurements can be viewed and analyzed via app or web.

The aim of the project is to create a static picture that can be regularly synced with a display showing permanent results by calling the netatmo api. The idea is based on [this tutorial](http://www.stephank383.de/tutorials/netatmo-kindle/index.html).
